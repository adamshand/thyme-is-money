A simple time keeping and invoicing application for freelancers. It is written in Javascript using React, Redux Toolkit, Chakra-UI and Formik for the front end, and Express, Knex and SQLite on the backend.

In it's current form it should be considered a fairly complete school project rather than a production ready piece of software.  There are no known bugs but there are some obvious missing features and it it needs some tidying up.

Originally written by @nicole-ferma, @yuricowan, @dajabe, and @adamshand for their final [DevAcademy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/) project in 2022.
